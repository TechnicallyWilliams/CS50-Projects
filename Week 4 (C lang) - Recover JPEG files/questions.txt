// How many different colors does BMP, GIF, JPEG, and PNG support?

BMP: 4.3 billion or 16 mill
GIF: 256
JPEG: 255
PNG: 16 million




// Which of the formats supports animation?

GIF




// What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?

lossy algorithms accept some degradation in the image in order to achieve smaller file size.
A lossless compression algorithm discards no information.




// What of these formats is lossy-compressed?

JPEG’s algorithm




// What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?

It rewrites the metadata that points to that file but leaves the disk blocks containing the file’s content intact. 
The file’s fat clusters aka disk blocks are then moved to the hard drive’s list of FREE clusters.




// What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?

Physically destroy the drive
Overwrite the drive's data with ASCII null value
Encrypt the files and throw away the key before retiriing the hard drive.




// What’s stdint.h?

def 1: stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library that allows programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs
that specify exact-width integer types, 

def 2: Library for Fixed-width integral types (stdint.h)




// What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

To create an interfacing data structure buffer for which the bytes of standardized files like bitmap can integrate into a program.

Ex. An array of primitive data types is the typical arrangement. 




// How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

typedef uint8_t  BYTE; ---> unsigned char      1 
byte
typedef uint32_t DWORD; --->  unsigned int     4 
bytes
typedef int32_t  LONG; ----> int,              4 
bytes
typedef uint16_t WORD; ----> unsigned short    2 bytes




// What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
(Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"

A unsigned short bfType of 0x4d42 Or 19778.




// What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure. (excluding fileheader storage and maybe more)
bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. (14 + 40) + (l x w + 3) +  (padding x height)




// What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

The bitmap will be read top-down and it's origin in the upper-left corner. 
This will need to be taken into account during resizing operations.





// What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

biBitCount




// Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?

The file isn't there.




// Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

Because we only want to read into one pixel at a time.




// What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

1 because adding one will create a number that is a multiple of 4 per bitmap conventions.




// What does fseek do?

Changes the offset of the file pointer fp so that you can begin looking at another row of pixels aka scanlines.




// What is SEEK_CUR?

It's an argument in fseek used to give you a starting pointer or reference pointer from which to start moving.
